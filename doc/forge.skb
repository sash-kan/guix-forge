  (chapter :title [Introduction]
    (p [guix-forge is a Guix service that lets you run a complete
,(ref :url "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(software)"
:text "software forge") in the manner of GitHub, GitLab, etc. Unlike
other free software forges such as GitLab, Gitea, etc., guix-forge is
not a monolith but is an assemblage of several pieces of server
software wired up to function as one. In this sense, it is a
,(emph "meta-service"). guix-forge does for software forges what ,(ref
:url "https://mailinabox.email/" :text "Mail-in-a-Box") does for
email.])
    (p [guix-forge is provided on a best effort basis. Its
design is unstable, and open to change. We will try our best to not
break your system configuration often, but it might happen.])
    (section :title [Philosophy]
      (p [In order to empower ordinary users, software should not just
be free (as in freedom), but also be simple and easy to deploy,
especially for small-scale deployments. guix-forge is therefore
minimalistic, and does not require running large database servers such
as MariaDB and PostgreSQL.])
      (p [While some state is inevitable, server software should
strive to be as stateless as an old analog television set. You switch
it on, and it works all the time. There are no pesky software updates,
and complex hidden state. guix-forge tries to be as stateless as
possible. Almost all of guix-forge's state can be version controlled,
and the rest are simple files that can be backed up easily.])
      (p [,(ref
:url "https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/23/Git-is-already-distributed.html"
:text "Git is already federated and decentralized") with
email. guix-forge acknowledges this and prefers to support git's ,(ref
:url "https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/02/Email-driven-git.html"
:text "email driven workflow") with project discussion, bug reports
and patches all happening over email.])))
